This application lets you use active_record's database migrations without a full blown Rails stack. Includes only the files necessary to run active_record migrations.

To get started:
setup your database connection information in config/database.yml

Create a database:
rake db:create

Create a new migration:
rails g migration create_users

This will create a file in db/migrate.

Add columns:
class CreateUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
    create_table :users do |t|
      t.string :name
    end
  end

  def self.down
    drop_table :users
  end
end

Perform the migration:
rake db:migrate

Now you have a working database which can be managed by this application.

Rollback to a previous version:
rake db:migrate VERISON=XXXX

The versioning of the database is managed in the database's schema_migrations table.
